Hi! I'm Melissa Schafer.

Iâ€™m interested in using data to find answers in persuasive, and relevant ways! 
I believe that data isn't just data: it is a way to factualize what's currently happening in the world and to broaden people's viewpoints. 
Coming from a biochemical background (within the industry for 9 years) I think that it's about the way you ask the question and what data you are using to answer that question.
Data origin should be questioned to see where more data could be collected or answered further!
